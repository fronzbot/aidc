A program that evolves a control circuit in order to optimize the design of a Switched DC-DC Converter controller.
The program is specifically meant to optimize the feedback network of the error amplifier in a typical DC Converter design.


Tasks:
- Interface with ngspice (Completed: 2013-05-30)
- Verify operation of various circuits
- Create GA to create basic circuits (voltage divider, etc)
- Verify creation of more complex analog blocks (filters, resonant circuits)
- Begin optimizing algorithm for converter feedback loop.
- Train program to understand pole/zero placement and how it can improve performance
- ???
- Profit!

Updates:
- 2013-05-30 : Current in the prototyping stages.
